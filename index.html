        <p>Should you’re a music lover like I am, then you likely understand that lots of artists don’t write their own tunes. In fact several songs' authors stay unknown. But you’d be amazed to understand that lots of the tunes we always sing in the shower are composed by other quite famous artists. For example, did you realize that famous singer Shel Silverstein composed a tune for Johnny Cash?  There are dozens and dozens of cases similar to this one, so here’s a record of 23 popular tunes which were covertly written by enormous celebrities . Please, continue reading, as #11, #8, and #5 will probably leave you amazed! </p>




<h2>#23. Islands In The Stream</h2>
<p>The famous tune Islands in the Stream has been listed by state celebrities Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton. It was a significant hit, and it obtained an American Music Award for the greatest single of this genre. Besides, the Academy of Country Music nominated as Best Duet of the Year both performers. Years later, the exact same article served rapper Pras Michel, from Fugees, to make the tune  Ghetto Superstar (That’s Everything You're ), that was contained in the soundtrack of the film Bullworth.</p>

<p>But this superb tune was written by none aside from the Bee Gees, inspired by a book by Ernest Hemingway of the identical name. Members of this group Robin and Barry Gibbs formerly told BBC Radio two their original aim was for Marvin Gaye to play with the tune, but in 1983they decided to really go for Kenny Rogers. If he could be accompanied by Parton, Rogers himself inquired. This tune gave Rogers and Parton their next NO.1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.</p>
<h2>#22. Diamonds</h2>
<p>“Shine bright like a diamond, glow bright like a diamond”.  Can these words ring a bell? I bet the very first time you heard that tune you couldn’t even get the tune! This tune was brilliantly translated by Rihanna, which leads everyone to feel she’s the songwriter.</p> 
<p>Thereforeit’ll likely surprise you to know that the real author of this song is none aside from pop legend Sia!  Actually, she’s been churning out hits for her fellow musicians such as Beyoncé, Britney Spears, and Kylie Minogue for a long time!</p>

<p>Sia co-wrote Diamonds at 2012. The tune went on to top the Billboard Hot 100. It had been NO.1 in twenty five nations and is among the best selling singles ever, with a total of 7.5 million copies. When interviewed by TheNew York Times, Sia disclosed she wrote it in only 14 minutes! What's more, manufacturer Benny Blanco explained that Rihanna listed the tune just as Sia’s demonstration.</p>
<h2>#21. Nothing Compares 2U</h2>
<p>You’t all heard the tune Nothing Compares 2U, correct? And allow me to guessyou probably believed that Sinéad O’Connor was also the person who composed it, didn’t one? Well, to your surprise, Prince composed and recorded this tune with his former group, The Family, in 1984. The ballad was finally handed over to the Irish up-and-comer Sinéad O’Connor in 1990, based on The Guardian. </p>

<p>You’d be interested to know ;s recording of this tune was discovered only two decades after his departure. It was April 2018, and Prince’s vault archivist, Michael Howe, was moving over a few of the older cassettes. And it appears to be the he stumbled upon a little cassette which included the first record of Nothing Compares 2U.</p>
<h2>#20. Fame</h2>
<p>Fame is just one of David Bowie‘s hits. But were you aware he’s not? Well, at least he’s not the only person who composed it. It is apparently that this tune was co-written from the Beatle legend John Lennon, the guitarist Carlos Alomar, and Bowie himself.</p>


<p>Photo: Courtesy of Best Life</p>
<p>These men were introduced by celebrity Elizabeth Taylor in a celebration in 1974, and since that time they recorded several tunes together. Bowie regretted not writing stuff “I actually desire, of course, in retrospect we worked more collectively. It was a joy. But we laughed a lot of.The majority was dumb. There wasn’t much function, as you can imagine,”, Bowie told Rocky Mountain News at 2004</p>
<h2>#19. Love Yourself</h2>
<p>There's not any doubt Ed Sheeran is among the greatest composers of the times. Does us delight but he's also 1 hell of a composer! He's written songs belonging to hip hop, folk, and distinct styles, though largely pop! However, did any of you understand he’s the writer of Justin Bieber’s hit tune Love Yourself? It was written by him and also this song landed in 15 nations singles charts.</p>


<p>Photo: Courtesy of Best Life</p>
<p>But two decades after the song had been published, Sheeran told Carson Daly that initially, the tune wasn’t meant for Bieber. Would you guess who?</p>
<p>“This was a song I'd written for Split. It wouldn&rsquo. And Justin took it and did his thing on it, and published it as one and made it what it is”, Sheeran informed Daly.</p>
<h2>#18. Irreplaceable</h2>
<p>There's not any doubt that Irreplaceable is just one of Beyonce‘s biggest hits. I’m sure that girls that are scorned have felt identified using its own lyrics, since it's much related to empowerment. But were you aware that the lyrics were written by a guy? Believe it or not, the writer is singer and pop Ne-Yo.</p> 


<p>Photo: Courtesy of Best Life</p>
<p>Confessed he regretted handing rather than keeping it. As he stated in a meeting to Option FM:</p>
<p>I frankly wrote that song for myself. However, that song taught me a lesson -- women and men don’t really feel that otherwise. ”</p>
<h2>#17. A Boy Named Sue</h2>
<p>Johnny Cash is among the best rock legends of all time. Many of his screenplay are played on the radio for a long time, for instance, catchy tune A Boy Named Sue.  But were you aware that Money really isn't the writer of the tune? The poet and writer Shel Silverstein, best known because of its literary function of his kids, was the guy who composed among Cash’s iconic records.</p>


<p>Photo: Courtesy of Best Life</p>
<p>The story claims that in February 1969, Johnny Cash had a party at his home in Hendersonville, Tennessee. As the day went on, the celebration turned with a few of rsquo & Johnny;their songs trying out. Silverstein was there, and he sang A Boy Named Sue. Money loved Silverstein’s and requested him to write the words down. He requested Silverstein if it could be sung by him. Crazy!</p>
<h2>#16. Party at the U.S.A.</h2>
<p>Miley Cyrus began as an actress in TV shows on Disney Channel, but finally, she moved on to become an effective pop performer. And just one  of those tunes that helped catapult her fame was Party at the U.S.A. But it might as a surprise which Cyrus’ NO.1 strike was composed by another person. Would you guess who?</p>

<p>This tune was composed by Jessie J. In actuality, Jessie wrote tunes for many renowned stars like Chris Brown and American Idol winner Lisa Lowes. As she told Glamour UK, “You’t got to write tunes, that’s in which the cash is, being an artist. ‘Party at the U.S.A’ paid rent, for example, three decades ”. </p>
<h2>#15. Miss Independent</h2>
<p>MissIndependent is just one of Kelly Clarkson’s biggest hits, but if she released the tune, she didn’t even understand that Christina Aguilera had assisted to compose its own lyrics. I understand what you’re! This doesn’t even! How did it occur? As Clarkson clarified on a incident of See What Happens -- Live! , Aguilera began writing the tune with a bunch of manufacturers, and it had been meant to show up on her fourth studio record, Stripped. But, Aguilera wasn & rsquo; t confident with this song's first draft and dropped it. However, what happened?</p>

<p>Well Clarkson completed it and picked up the song, and it turned into her initial Idol single. However, if the tune was picked up by her, she didn’t even understand .</p>
<p>“My tag in the time didn’t tell me but I suppose the producers and authors began it with her it wasn’t ended so I ended up composing the remainder and completing it before knowing she had been on it or of it,” Clarkson explained.</p>
<h2>#14. Stunning</h2>

The writer of this tune isn't Aguilera himself, however Linda Perry.  She initially supposed to include this song on her first solo record after the breakup of her former group, 4 Non-Blondes. However one afternoon, Aguilera contacted Perry and asked if she can help her to the makeup of her next record, Stripped.  Both fulfilled in Perry’s home, where every played a few tunes to break the ice.

We to listen to it is sung by Christina. … I was Wow, & lsquo; like. ’ This is what's available on the radio. ” Since its launch in 2002, this tune has won a lot of awards, and it's acknowledged because of its own message of self-empowerment. It is regarded as a classic of this LGBTQIA community.</p>
<h2>#13. Forget You</h2>>

Among the record ’s tunes was Red Red Wine, and it became so famous that lots of people came to think that it was a first tune of this group. Regrettably, UB40’s understanding of musical background down them, since they'd always supposed that the tune was written by an unknown Jamaican singer. On the other hand, a singer actually wrote the tune.</p>

<p>Neil Diamond listed Red Red Wine in 1967 to get Only For You, his next record. Astro, a longtime member of UB40, told Billboard that he didn’t connect the dots once he noticed the tune credit was pronounced as “N. Diamond. ” Wonderful! Why rsquo didn &;t anybody tell him?</p>
